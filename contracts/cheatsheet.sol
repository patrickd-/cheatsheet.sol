 * You may not declare state variables with a name used in a base contract (shadowing)!
 *
 * Inheritance means that components of the parent contracts are "merged" into the inheriting contract!
 * The parent contracts do not need to be deployed, since everything will be contained in the child.
 * Order of "merging" is that the right most contracts override those on the left (C3 Linearization).
 *
 * The order of inheritance should start with the least derived contract (most general, usually an
 * interface) and end with the most specific, to avoid inheriting the incorrect function implementation.
